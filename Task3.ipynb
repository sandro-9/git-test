CPU is using interrupts, which notifies operating system to for example, read input (cin) or that there's just invalid instructions etc. It tries to arrange everything in a fair way, since many processes may be running at the same time. Also at the end return 0 indicates operating system that there were no errors and program finished successfuly"
